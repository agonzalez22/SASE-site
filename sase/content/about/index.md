## Our Chapter

The Northeastern University chapter of SASE (NUSASE) was founded in Spring 2013 by two senior Mechanical Engineering students. Since gaining university recognition as an organization in Fall 2013, our chapter has grown significantly. We take pride in our active participation and membership in Northeastern's Pan Asian American Council (PAAC), College of Engineering Student Activities Council (SAC), and the College of Science Student Leadership Council (SLC).

NEU SASE has garnered recognition through various achievements, earning multiple awards from National SASE, including accolades such as 'Most Improved,' 'Most Influential,' and 'Overall Strongest.' These accomplishments reflect our continuous growth as a thriving organization.


We host a wide variety of events and programs throughout the year. We host biweekly general meetings on Tuesdays, from 6-7 PM. Events such as networking banquets and resume workshops help develop professional growth in our members. We regularly collaborate with a diverse range of organizations from Northeastern PAAC and various STEM organizations. Give back to the Greater Boston community through our service events, where we regularly volunteer with the Greater Boston Food Bank, Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), and Dana Farber. SASEPals is our mentorship initative aimsed at fostering meaningful connections among our members. Pairing can be based on academic major, career path, or shared hobbies. Each pairing is unique and tailored to individual interests.
